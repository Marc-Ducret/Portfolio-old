                In Stealing Cubes, you are inside a sphere and must gather as much cubes as you can. While
                doing so, the glowing spheres get more and more angry and try to hit you.",

                    The environment is the inside of a sphere. You can walk everywhere inside it and gravity pulls away
                    from the center of the sphere. This was a bit of a technical challenge to have the player
                    facing the right way but after some thinking we ended up with simple and elegant solutions.
                    Basically, at each time frame, we apply on the player the smallest rotation such that the player
                    becomes aligned with gravity."},
