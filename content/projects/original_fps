                    The goal of this project is to answer the conceptual issues that current FPS have: mainly a lack
                    of strategic decision making, uninteresting objectives, time spend dead or too few emphasis on
                    staying alive. Now, of course no game have all those issues but most have some."},

                    <p>
                    My approach to answer those issues is to look at the currently thriving genres: DotA likes and
                    survival games.

                    The first idea is to put a strong emphasis on 'economy': some form of currency
                    shall be collected and used to buy weapons and gear. Then the goal shouldn't be arbitrary points
                    but structural damage on the opposing base. The asymmetry of defense and offense is very rich
                    but having those two positions evolve during a match makes it even deeper (this is one of the
                    things DotA likes do best in my opinion).

                    The second idea is to give incentives to stay alive and reward kills without death timers.
                    Instead, like in survival games, a player would drop his gear upon death but respawn quickly
                    at his base."},

                    While trying to make games using only OpenGL and no engine was enriching it also had me realize

                    version is a prototype that aims at learning Unity and refining the concept."},
