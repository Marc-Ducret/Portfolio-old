                    This story begins in 2011 when a friend and I had this idea of a robot fighting game
                    where you would build and program the robot. <br/>
                    We started working on the first 3D prototype (no pictures here). However we quickly
                    were overwhelmed with the synchronized networking of physic bodies."},

                    Years later, I got back on the project alone. In the meantime, I learned about
                    deterministic lockstep and here was my solution for networked multiplayer. For the sake
                    of simplicity, I started with a 2D prototype. <br/>

                    Therefore I started working on a new 3D prototype. I properly laid down the foundations of
                    a simple 3D engine based on OpenGL. This engine aims at displaying colored low poly models
                    with automatically highlighted edges.<br/>
