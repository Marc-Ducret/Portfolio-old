                    This project was conducted by me and a friend in the context of our Operating System and Computer
                    Networks course at the ENS. We were not given much help apart from being advised to used QEmu and
                    to look up on the internet for examples."},

                    Our OS for the x86 architecture accumulated the following features. It can schedule multiple
                    processes, each having its own virtual memory. Any process can chose to display things, if
                    multiple active processes do so, the user can chose which one to look at. Programs can be
                    developed in C using a custom 'standard library'. Many Syscalls are implemented and enable, among
                    other things, a Filesystem, communication between processes and dynamic memory allocation.
                    A basic shell program is implemented."},
