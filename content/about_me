    {"type": "text", "title": "First attempt at programing", "text": "
        I started being interested in programming in 2008 (I was 12). At this point, I took a look at C++, PHP, HTML
        and CSS. I wasn't really able to achieve anything and the lack of goal had me give up and play around
        with video editing and modeling software instead."},
    {"type": "text", "title": "The Minecraft Experience", "text": "
        Two years latter, I got involved in a Minecraft server (minecraft-fr.net). This server had the ambition
        of being strictly Role Play. For that matter we wanted to have some currency item that could be exchanged.
        I learned Java to do just that and worked through the decompiled and obfuscated sources of Minecraft.
        At this point in time, there was no tool to restore the names in the sources and to my knowledge, there
        was no other server that managed to have custom items."},
    {"type": "text", "text": "
        After that we added many other things such as barley, beer, a job system, alchemy (there was no alchemy in
        Minecraft at this point) and more. In this 2010 - 2011 period is was in charge of the modding and helped
        with some more general decisions. I collaborated with many different programmers."},
    {"type": "text", "text": "
        This experience was extremely enriching for me. First of all it was the beginning of my development passion.
        But more importantly, it gave me a sense of responsibility early in life. It also taught me about teamwork."},
    {"type": "text", "title": "SlimeVoid", "text": "
        Towards the end of 2011 me and another administrator of minecraft-fr.net left to pursue new modding endeavours.
        We co-founded <a href='http://slimevoid.net'>SlimeVoid</a>, an unofficial organization about creating
        original Minecraft mods. Compared to the minecraft-fr.net experience, the success here was on a much bigger
        scale as we accumulated a few million downloads. However I missed the more personal relation that we had
        with the players of the server. Some of ours SlimeVoid projects are displayed on the <a href='?content=projects'>
        Projects</a> page."},
    {"type": "text", "title": "Game Development", "text": "
        At some point, I got rather annoyed by the limitations of modding. The logical followup was to consider game
        development. Since then, I worked on many, mostly unfinished, game projects, alone or with few collaborators.
        I started using Java and OpenGL but I came to realize how helpful an existing engine can be. Therefore I am now
        focusing my efforts on Unity which I'm starting to love more and more."},
    {"type": "text", "title": "Games I played", "text": "
        Here some games that I played and felt like they impacted me. Age Of Empires II, Counter Strike: Source,
        World of Warcraft, Garry's Mod, Minecraft, Startcraft II, Dota 2, Rust."},
